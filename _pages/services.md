      <p>
        We specialize in industrial design services, offering support from the initial concepts to the final design.
        We've helped startups get to the next level (from humble beginnings to IPO), and worked with established
        companies to innovate and stay ahead of the competition.

      <p>
        We are committed to help our clients succeed by offering support throughout the entire product development, from
        the initial concepts to the final product. In collaboration with our partners we can offer additional services
        beyond industrial design. Our partner network includes experts in mechanical engineering, packaging design, and
        manufacturing.

      <h2>Phase One</h2>
      <p>
        Discover
        <br>
        During the initial discovery phase, we gather and analyze a wide range of data. This includes understanding the
        client's requirements, their unique brand identity, the needs of their target audience, as well as the latest
        market trends and competition. Through research, observation, and user empathy, we identify patterns, pain
        points, and opportunities. In collaboration with the client, we define opportunities and establish clear goals
        for the project. This phase establishes a strong foundation for a purposeful design process.
        <br>
        <br>
        Ideate
        <br>
        Using the knowledge from the Discover phase, we generate ideas, explore concepts, and address problems through
        sketching, brainstorming, and creating prototypes.

      <h2>Phase Two</h2>
      <p>
        Conceptualize
        <br>
        Next, we create 3D models of the selected ideas from the previous phase, for more precise visualization and
        further design exploration. Prototyping can involve various methods such as 3D printing, laser cutting, or
        handcrafting.
        <br>
        <br>
        Test
        <br>
        Prototypes are tested to validate the design. This iterative process helps identify any potential issues and
        allows us to make improvements and refinements to ensure the final design meets the requirements for
        functionality and user satisfaction.

        <br>
        Design
        <br>
        Detailed and precise 3D CAD model, ensuring the design is both elegant and user-friendly. This CAD model will
        then be handed over to the engineering team for further development and implementation. In addition, we generate
        photo realistic renderings that present the product's colors, materials, and finishes. To effectively
        communicate design specifications to manufacturers and other stakeholders, we create a comprehensive document
        known as a "tech-pack".

      <h2>Phase Three</h2>
      <p>
        Collaborate
        <br>
        Design for manufacturing (DFM) is a collaborative phase that involves industrial designers and engineers.
        Industrial designers focus on creating visually appealing and user-friendly designs, while engineers bring their
        technical expertise in manufacturing processes. This collaboration is essential to ensure that the original
        design intent is preserved to achieve a final design that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing, while
        also being feasible and cost-effective to manufacture.
        <br>
        <br>
        Support
        <br>
        We remain involved throughout the process, verifying the intended design until the product is shipped. This may
        include tasks such as production supervision and quality inspection to ensure that the manufactured products
        meet the required design standards and specifications.
