                <h3>Discovery</h3>
                <p>During the initial discovery phase, we gather and analyze a wide range of data. This includes
                    understanding the client's requirements, their unique brand identity, the needs of their target
                    audience, as well as the latest market trends and competition.</p>
                <p>Through research, observation, and user empathy, we identify patterns, pain points, and
                    opportunities. In collaboration with the client, we define opportunities and establish clear goals
                    for the project. This phase establishes a strong foundation for a purposeful design process.</p>
                <h3>Ideation</h3>
                <p>Using the knowledge from the Discovery phase, we generate ideas, explore concepts, and address
                    problems through sketching, brainstorming, and creating prototypes.</p>

                <h3>Conceptualize</h3>
                <p>Next, we create 3D models of the selected ideas from the previous phase, for more precise
                    visualization and further design exploration. Prototyping can involve various methods such as 3D
                    printing, laser cutting, or handcrafting.</p>
                <h3>Test</h3>
                <p>Prototypfes are tested to validate the design. This iterative process helps identify any potential
                    issues and allows us to make improvements and refinements to ensure the final design meets the
                    requirements for functionality and user satisfaction.</p>
                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>Detailed and precise 3D CAD model, ensuring the design is both elegant and user-friendly. This CAD
                    model will then be handed over to the engineering team for further development and implementation.
                </p>
                <p>In addition, we generate photo realistic renderings that present the product's colors, materials, and
                    finishes. To effectively communicate design specifications to manufacturers and other stakeholders,
                    we create a comprehensive document known as a "tech-pack".</p>

                <h3>Collaborate</h3>
                <p>Design for manufacturing (DFM) is a collaborative phase that involves industrial designers and
                    engineers. Industrial designers focus on creating visually appealing and user-friendly designs,
                    while engineers bring their technical expertise in manufacturing processes.</p>
                <p>This collaboration is essential to ensure that the original design intent is preserved to achieve a
                    final design that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing, while also being feasible and
                    cost-effective to manufacture.</p>
                <h3>Support</h3>
                <p>We remain involved throughout the process, verifying the intended design until the product is
                    shipped. This may include tasks such as production supervision and quality inspection to ensure that
                    the manufactured products meet the required design standards and specifications.</p>
