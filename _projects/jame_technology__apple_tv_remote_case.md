client: "Jame Technology"
year: "2017"
sector: "Consumer electronics, mobile accessories"
description: "Ergonomic gaming case designed to protect and enhance the Apple TV Siri Remote for an optimal gaming experience."
brief: "Best Buy sought a silicone gaming case design for the Apple TV Siri Remote, to offer protection and function for their customers."
solution: "Clay was the most natural first choice to explore and find the best ergonomic shape for a great gaming experience. After identifying the right shape using clay, we carefully refined it into a clean and geometric form that complements Apple's design language, while retaining the comfortable gaming grip and drop-protection. Our research found that customers complain of having a hard time finding the Apple remote due to its size and color, so we chose a bright red color for this case that appeals to gamers' preference for bold colors and ensures the remote is easily spotted in any living room."
