title: "Level Wallet Case for iPhone"
client: "Patchworks"
year: "2018"
sector: "Consumer electronics, mobile accessories"
description: "An innovative wallet case made using only two parts"
brief: "Patchworks sought a patentable wallet case design that would securely hold one, two or three credit cards using minimal manufacturing."
solution: "We designed an innovative solution by utilizing the material properties for their best functional use. The case comprises two parts: a sturdy PC outer shell and a flexible TPU inner wrap. The TPU bumps designed into the back can flex to a flat position when cards are inserted, and return to their original form when cards are removed. The bumps flex slightly more with each additional card inserted. This unique bump mechanism securely holds one, two, or three cards without the risk of any falling out. The case has everything it needs and nothing more: a win-win product both for the customer and the manufacturer."
