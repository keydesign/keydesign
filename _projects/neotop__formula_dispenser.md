title: "Accurate, Easy-to-use and Germ-free Universal Dispenser for Infant Formula"
client: "Neotop"
year: "2013"
sector: "Children's products, infant feeding"
description: "Formula dispenser that accurately pre-measures and dispenses one scoop of formula at a time, while safeguarding the remaining formula from outside germs."
brief: "A neonatology doctor approached us with the idea for a formula dispenser that would eliminate many common issues of exposing the formula to germs. Lack of hygiene is the biggest reason for formula-related mortality in third world countries."
solution: "This dispenser accurately dispenses one measure of formula at a time, eliminating the need for a scoop and reducing formula exposure to environmental germs. Through extensive research of the baby formula market and other dispenser-related industries, we developed multiple variations and models, resulting in an innovative, accurate, understandable, and intuitive dispenser."
