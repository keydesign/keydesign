title: "Sleep Apnea Monitor"
client: "Somnarus"
year: "2016"
sector: "Medical devices, wearable technology"
description: "A single-use sleep apnea monitor designed to track user sleep data and store it on an memory card for physician analysis and evaluation."
brief: "Somnarus, a medical startup, required a design for their sleep apnea wearable that would meet end-user expectations for comfort and ease-of-use. Additionally, it needed to be user-friendly for doctors and reasonably priced for manufacturing."
solution: "With the goal of one-size-fits-all usage, we started our design discovery work by building functional prototypes to test on clay models and human subjects. Through numerous iterations, we developed a range of different shapes and tested them with various adhesives on multiple face topologies. This process allowed us to discover a universal shape that provides comfortable fit for all users. The monitor is used in two ways: first by the patient at home and then by the doctor. Every element of the form has a functional or instructional reason to clearly communicate how to use it the right way. For example, the landscape orientation with small ridges on both sides informs the patient where to hold the module with both hands when attaching it on the forehead. These same markings are the guideline for the doctor to know where to cut open the module to access the internal SD card with the collected data, without damaging it during the cut."
