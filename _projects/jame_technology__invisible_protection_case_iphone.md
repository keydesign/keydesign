title: "Invisible Protection: an Innovative iPhone Case with a Protective Frame"
client: "Jame Technology"
year: "2018"
sector: "Consumer electronics, mobile accessories"
description: "Slim, stylish and inexpensive (to produce), this iPhone case with a unique frame design ensures maximum protection for the most fragile part of the iPhone."
brief: "The client wanted a unique, patentable, budget-friendly, slim yet rugged case for the latest iPhone."
solution: "Our initial research found that the iPhone's most breakable area lies at the edges of its glass. Many rugged cases available on the market suffer from bulkiness due to multiple parts or use costly specialized materials to offer all-around protection, but we designed an innovative protective case using only one material, featuring an \"air bubble\" around the edge of the glass. Our design redirects impact away from the most fragile points, dispersing it towards the firmer areas of the phone and through the triangular pattern on the back for enhanced protection. This creates a hidden but very powerful protection for the phone."
