year: 2017
sector: "Consumer electronics, digital health"
link: "https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/stemp-smart-temperature-patch#/"
Description: "Smart fever monitor constantly measures temperature and sends smartphone alerts for parents and caregivers."
brief: “Stemp's founding team needed an industrial design for their prototype wireless thermometer, and graphic design for their Indiegogo fundraising campaign.”
solution: “Keydesign created a housing around Stemp's working PCB prototype and designed an easy to use peel-and-place adhesive for attachment. As the product neared the Indiegogo launch, we also helped redesign the graphics for the website to give a clear message to the consumer, leading to a successful Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign.”
