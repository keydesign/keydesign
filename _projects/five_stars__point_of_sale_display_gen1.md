title: "Point of Sale Display: Gen 1"
client: "Fivestars"
year: 2018
sector: "Consumer electronics, point of sale"
link: "https://www.fivestars.com/"
description: "Point of Sale Display for collecting user data and offering repeat-visit loyalty rewards."
brief: "Keydesign supported Fivestars, a startup offering loyalty and payment services to small businesses, by designing three generations of POS products as their user base increased, ultimately leading to their acquisition by SumUp. For this first product, they asked for a simple and low cost solution to trial the market."
solution: "We assisted Fivestars in creating and developing their first ever hardware product: a tablet enclosure that allowed easier customer input at point-of-sale, with a distinct Fiverstars visual identity. Our top priority was ensuring the intuitiveness and ergonomic design of the product, as it is frequently used by many people, often for the first time, emphasizing a seamless and user-friendly experience. The success of this first-generation product relied heavily on its serviceability and affordability. The product's maintenance-friendly design consists of just two easily disassembled parts."
