title: "Fresh-Air Thermostat"
description: "A thermostat which visually displays the setting of a new fresh-air home air conditioning system: heat (red), cool (blue), or outside fresh air (green)"
brief: "Nature's Cooling Solutions wanted a thermostat to showcase their new fresh-air air conditioning technology."
solution: "In a crowded market of smart thermostats, Keydesign wanted to make a solution that was immediately visually differentiating, yet clean and simple to highlight the brand attributes of Nature's Cooling Solutions. The translucent external rim lights up to give the user an ambient view of the system's current state, and the UX layout makes it clear to understand how to setup the various thermostat functions."
