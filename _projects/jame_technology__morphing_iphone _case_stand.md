description: "Fashion-inspired innovative iPhone case featuring a folio cover that transforms into a phone stand."
brief: "Many cases on the market with stand functionality are composed of multiple parts and tend to be bulky. The goal was to design an innovative iPhone case that seamlessly blends fashion and functionality."
solution: "This case is inspired by the charm and mobility of Issey Miyake's Bao Bao bags. The innovative cover design has built-in magnets that connect together to create the stand, and the user can deploy it with a simple grip gesture. The stand is available when needed and disappears when not in use."
