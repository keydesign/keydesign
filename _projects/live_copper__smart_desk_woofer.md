description: “The Model C Bass subwoofer is a 150 Watt high-end woofer with customizable mid-range and bass, designed for home office use.”
brief: ”Livecopper, a startup aspiring to lead the market for smart desk accessories, approached Keydesign to design their first-generation products with a clear vision of future growth, keeping costs and functionality in balance. The Model C Bass subwoofer should offer premium sound in a form that fits the overall brand identity.” 
solution: “Model C bass subwoofer is engineered to deliver exceptional and customizable sound, while also allowing for easy assembly (DFA) to achieve a clean and brand-aligned visual design. The deep woofer sound bounces off the foot’s convex surface, dispersing throughout the entire room.”
