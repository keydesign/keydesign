title: "Point of Sale Display: Gen 3"
client: "Fivestars"
year: "2020"
sector: "Consumer electronics, point of sale"
description: "A modular point of sale product designed for two different customers."
brief: "Keydesign supported Fivestars, a startup offering loyalty and payment services to small businesses, by designing three generations of POS products as their user base increased, ultimately leading to their acquisition by SumUp. In this third generation device, they wanted to make a stronger brand statement in this competitive market."
solution: "As Fivestars' business expanded, the need for a fully custom-made product became apparent. We designed an innovative product that catered to Fivestars' diverse customer needs, allowing seamless usage as Loyalty-only or easily adaptable for those who also desired Loyalty + Pay options, by simply adding the optional payment base module. By creating this modular design, we significantly decreased production and distribution costs. Despite the increased complexity compared to the previous-generation designs, we successfully maintained the Fivestars' visual identity that we had defined from the beginning."
