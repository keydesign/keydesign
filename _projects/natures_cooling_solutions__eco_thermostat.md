title: "Fresh-air Thermostat"
client: "Nature’s Cooling Solutions"
sector: "Consumer electronics, smart home"
description: "A digital thermostat for a new fresh-air home air conditioning system that features a unique visual indicator showing the functional state: heat (red), cool (blue), or outside fresh air (green)"
brief: "Nature's Cooling Solutions wanted a thermostat design to showcase their new fresh-air air conditioning technology."
solution: "We used a clean and minimalistic design for the thermostat to integrate well into diverse households. To celebrate the unique fresh-air intake capability of our client's eco-thermostat, we used color as a metaphor to visually inform the user of the device status."
