brief: "After running a successful Kickstarter campaign, Tilt Five approached our team to collaborate on the packaging design for a keepsake box that would house their innovative AR glasses. They sought our expertise to ensure a memorable unboxing experience for their enthusiastic Kickstarter backers."
solution: "The design not only showcases the content inside the box but also conveys the magic that awaits when the AR glasses are worn, transforming the world into an immersive three-dimensional augmented reality. The choice of colors, graphics, and gold foil material enhances this captivating experience, visually communicating the enchantment of the games."
