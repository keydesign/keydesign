Every product serves two 'users': the client we support and the end-user we serve. Industrial designers, like myself,
are trained to prioritize the end-user experience, creating intuitive, functional, and beautiful solutions. Meanwhile,
business managers seek to minimize costs and maximize profits. These seemingly conflicting interests are both essential.
My approach involves balancing the needs of both parties, aiming to create products that not only meet user expectations
but also drive business success.

Why is it crucial to consider both sides? Focusing solely on the end user and ignoring business needs can lead to
business failure, ultimately impacting the end user. However, designing solely for profit may result in products that do
not meet user expectations, eventually harming the business.

Designers possess a unique skill set that enables us to tackle challenges creatively. By giving equal weight to both
user needs and business objectives, we can create solutions that deliver value to everyone involved, fostering win-win
outcomes.

The wallet case I designed is a good example of a Win-Win product. By strategically selecting two different materials
and leveraging their unique properties, combined with an innovative form, I achieved multiple user-centric features with
only two components. This approach minimizes production costs while retaining all desired functionality. The case serves
as a wallet, adjusting pressure to securely hold various quantities of cards, includes a corner bumper for shock
absorption, and features a kickstand.
